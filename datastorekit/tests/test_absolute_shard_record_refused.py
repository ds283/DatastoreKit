"""
A primary whose ``shards`` records are **absolute paths** is refused by every reader, and neither it
nor the store it names is read, written, moved or deleted.

This is the safety property that the legacy-record tests used to guard. A primary written before
shard records were bare file names recorded its shards by absolute path, and a copy of such a
primary still named the **original's** shards, so that a pool opened on such a copy read and wrote
the original. The property once held because an absolute record was read by its final component, as
a sibling of the primary. It now holds because the record is refused: ``resolve_shard_path`` raises
``ValueError`` on anything but a bare file name, and every reader reports "Shard #N ... has an
unusable record".

Two stores are built in a temporary directory, each with stand-in shard files (small placeholders
holding a marker, as in ``shard_store_fixtures``; everything here is refused before any shard is
opened as a database):

* **A**, whose records are bare names;
* **B**, whose records are the absolute paths of A's existing shard files. B has shard files of its
  own beside its primary, under the same names. This is the shape of a copy of such a primary.

For each entry point, B is refused, the error names shard #0 and "unusable record", and the whole
tree, both stores, is unchanged: every file's content, every mtime, every directory entry.

A third store, **C**, records absolute paths naming **its own** siblings, the shape every store
written before shard records were bare file names held. It was once read by name; it is refused now,
like B.

No Ray, no datastore.
