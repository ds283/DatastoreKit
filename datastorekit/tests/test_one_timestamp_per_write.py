"""
One timestamp per replicated write, on every path that writes a replicated row.

The check at open compares every column of every replicated table, ``timestamp`` included. That is
sound only if every path that writes a replicated row gives every shard's copy the same timestamp.
Each test here runs an existing test of one such path with the Datastore module's ``datetime``
replaced by ``test_replicated_write._TickingDatetime``, whose ``now()`` is a new value on every
call: a shard that stamped its own time would stamp a value no other shard holds, and a value in
2030, which no driver's clock gives. Each existing test already asserts full-row identity
(``SELECT *``, timestamp included) on every shard afterwards; here that assertion also requires
that no replicated row on any shard carries a shard's tick.

1. the clean write (get, store, validate): ``test_replicated_write.TestCleanWrite.
   test_every_copy_is_row_identical``, which already runs under the ticking clock; not repeated;
2. the repair at open of an interrupted get, store or validate, at every commit point:
   ``test_reconcile_at_open.TestKillAndReopen``, and the same repair followed by the prune at
   open, ``TestPruningAfterRepair``;
3. the completion at open of an interrupted prune: ``test_prune_at_open.TestInterruptedPrune``;
4. the prune at open: ``test_prune_at_open.TestUninterruptedPrune``;
5. the version row's write, on a new store, under a new label, and its repair after an
   interrupted write: ``test_version_row_at_open``'s ``TestNewStore``, ``TestNewLabelInterrupted``
   and ``TestNewStoreInterrupted``. The version table has no ``timestamp`` column, and its rows
   are compared there by ``(serial, label)``, which is the whole row; that is asserted here.
   Those tests compare only the version rows, so each also ends here by comparing every
   replicated table of the last store it opened, whole rows, on every shard.

No Ray is initialised; every store is built in a temporary directory.
