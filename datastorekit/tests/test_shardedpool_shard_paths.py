"""
Where ``ShardedPool`` finds its shards, read from the primary's ``shards`` table, and what it does
when one is missing.

``_write_shard_data`` once recorded every shard by **absolute** path and ``_read_shard_data`` used
that path as it stood, so:

* a **copied** store opened against the *original's* shards, read them, wrote to them and put a
  ``version`` row into each;
* a **moved** store opened with the stale paths, and the ``Datastore`` actor behind each one,
  finding no file there, created an empty database at the old location. The pool opened, and
  everything in it looked uncomputed.

Now shards are recorded by bare file name, every record is read through the one resolver in
``datastorekit/shard_paths.py``, which refuses a record that is not a bare name (an absolute record
is pinned as refused by ``test_absolute_shard_record_refused``), and ``_check_shard_files`` refuses
to go on if any resolved shard is missing, before any actor exists.

Everything here runs on an instance made with ``object.__new__(ShardedPool)`` in a temporary
directory, through the real ``_create_engine`` / ``_write_shard_data`` / ``_read_shard_data`` /
``_check_shard_files``. The constructor, which starts Ray actors, is never called. No Ray, no
datastore, per `CLAUDE.md`.

This module deliberately does **not** import ``datastorekit.shard_paths``, so that it can be run
against the unfixed ``ShardedPool`` for the deliberate-breakage record.
