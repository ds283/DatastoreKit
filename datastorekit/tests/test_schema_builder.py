"""
The one schema builder, ``Datastore/SQL/schema.py`` ``build_schema`` (store-fingerprint prompt 01).

- **The witness is the one for the current schema design, named in one constant, ``WITNESS``.**
  Both ``build_schema`` and the actor's ``_build_schema`` reproduce that file exactly. The actor's
  method is called without Ray and without its ``__init__``
  (``schema_description.actor_with_built_schema``), so the second test shows that the actor
  delegates to the function and has not kept its own copy.
- **Witnesses are never overwritten or regenerated** (``prompts/datastore-integrity`` README
  §6.2 D5). ``schema_at_base.json`` witnessed a refactor that changed nothing: it was captured from
  the code before the schema builder moved (store-fingerprint prompt 01; that prompt's log records
  how, and at which SHA), and it is kept as the record of that. Each deliberate schema change adds a
  witness beside it, ``schema_at_<campaign>-<NN>.json``, captured with ``schema_description.py``'s
  ``__main__``, and repoints ``WITNESS`` at it; the prompt's log carries the diff between the two
  witnesses as the reviewable statement of what changed. No witness is ever regenerated to make a
  test pass. The current one is ``schema_at_extraction-06.json``, the neutral test client's
  schema, captured by prompt 06 of the extraction campaign from the registry's classes with a
  table; it differs from the earlier ``schema_at_extraction-04a.json``, captured by prompt 04a in
  the same way and kept, only by the ``key_on_version`` of each record. The source repository's
  earlier witnesses, from ``schema_at_base.json`` to ``schema_at_datastore-generic-07.json``, are
  that repository's history of its own schema, and are not copied here.
- **The fix** of ``[00-build-schema-reads-registration-before-its-none-check]``: a factory whose
  ``register()`` returns ``None`` gets a record with no table, and no ``AttributeError``.

No Ray, no datastore, nothing under ``var/``.
