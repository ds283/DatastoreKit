"""
A structured inventory of a **closed** ShardedPool store: what it holds, named by physical labels.

``read_inventory(primary, factories)`` opens the store with ``open_read_only`` (prompt 01) and
returns a ``StoreInventory``. ``factories`` is the registry of storable classes, which the caller
gives (prompts/datastore-generic, prompt 06). For each class it holds ``records``, their
``count``, the earliest and latest ``timestamp`` (for display only: no timestamp is in any record)
and ``problems``, a list of named strings. It reads; it never writes, and it needs no Ray.

**A record** (``Record``) is a small JSON-safe object:

- ``key``: the class's physical identity. Its leaves are canonical (``canonical``), and a reference
  to a parent row is the **digest of that parent's own canonical identity** (``reference_digest``),
  never its serial. The parent itself is a record of its own class. No serial or timestamp is in a
  key; a label or name is in one only where the class declares it a leaf, because it *is* the
  identity;
- ``tags``: the sorted tuple of the tag labels on the row's association rows, ``()`` where the
  class has no association table. The tag table and its columns are the layer's own
  (``Datastore.contract``);
- ``validated``: the row's flag, or ``None`` where the class has no such column;
- ``value_count``: the number of rows in the class's value table whose parent is this row, or
  ``None`` where the class has none. The value tables are counted, one ``GROUP BY`` per table per
  shard, and never listed.

A computed-values field can be added to ``Record`` later, beside these four and outside ``key``,
without changing what they are.

**Who defines identity.** Each factory declares its key, as data, in a static ``inventory_spec()``
beside its existing ``inventory()``: an ``InventorySpec`` naming the leaf columns, the parent
references and the association and value tables (prompts/datastore-generic, prompt 08). A factory
whose class is not in the inventory declares none (``SQLAFactoryBase.inventory_spec`` returns
``None``). This module does the reading, in ``read_records``.

**Which classes, in which order.** The classes are those of the registry that declare a spec, and
their order is derived from what the specs declare (``inventory_classes``): first the classes that
reference nothing, in registry order; then, one at a time, the earliest class in registry order
whose parents have all been placed. A class depends on every class its parents and parent sets
name, every class a polymorphic parent's type map names, and the tag table if it is tagged. The
driver builds classes in that order and hands ``read_records``, in ``context``, a map from serial
to canonical key and to reference digest for every class already built **on that shard**, and a
map from serial to reference digest for every class already built on **every** shard, which a
``cross_shard`` parent resolves against (the store is still read once, and only for reading).

**A polymorphic parent.** A key field may reference a row whose class is named per row by a type
column: ``Parent(column, type_column=..., types={type value: class, ...})``. The referencing
factory declares the map; the layer knows only that one column names the class and another holds
the serial.

**Floats (decision D1).** ``canonical`` is the one function that turns a leaf into its canonical
form. A float becomes ``float.hex`` of the value **as stored**; an integer, string, boolean or
``None`` is kept as it is. The lookups match floats within 1e-7; the key records the stored bits.

**Shards.** A sharded class is the union of every shard's records. A replicated class is read from
every shard and compared on key, tags, validated flag and value count; its records are the
lowest-serial shard's, and any shard that differs is a named problem (``replicated-divergence``).
Which classes are replicated is what the store's primary records in its ``replicated_tables`` table
(``ReadOnlyStore.replicated_tables``), not anything this module or its caller says. Nothing is
repaired.

**Named problems.** Each problem string starts with its name:

- ``replicated-divergence``: a replicated class differs between shards;
- ``duplicate``: two or more records of a class share a key and a tag set. All are kept;
- ``orphan-value``: value rows whose parent row is not on their shard;
- ``orphan-tag``: association rows whose parent row or whose tag is not on their shard;
- ``unresolved-parent``: rows referencing a parent row that cannot be resolved. They are not
  records;
- ``empty-parent-set``: rows of a class keyed on a set of parents (``ParentSet``) that have no
  member rows. They are not records;
- ``orphan-member``: member rows of a ``ParentSet`` table whose owning row is not on their shard.

**A set of parents** (``ParentSet``, prompts/datastore-integrity prompt 09b). A row may be
assembled from several parent rows, recorded in a member table with one member row per parent
combination, each naming the row that owns it. Such a key field's value is the digest of its
member fields' names and the sorted list of its resolved members, each member the tuple, in those
fields' order, of the reference digests of the rows it names (``None`` for a nullable field that
names none). Like every parent reference it is formed from the parents' own identities, never
their serials; the members are kept beside the records, in ``ClassInventory.parent_sets``, so that
a display can render the set by its physical labels. The member table is read once per shard,
read-only, as the tag and value tables are.

This module imports only the standard library, ``sqlalchemy`` and ``Datastore.contract`` at module
scope, so a factory can import it from inside its ``inventory_spec``. The reader is imported inside
``read_inventory``, and the factory registry is given to it.
