"""
A read-only reader over a **closed** ShardedPool store.

``open_read_only(primary, factories)`` is a context manager. It finds the store's shards through
``ShardedPool._read_closed_store`` (the one implementation of reading and checking a primary's
``shards`` table), opens every shard file read-only, and builds the tables once with the one schema
builder, ``Datastore.SQL.schema.build_schema``, from the registry ``factories`` it is given: the
reader imports no registry (prompts/datastore-generic, prompt 06). It yields a ``ReadOnlyStore``;
on exit it disposes every engine it made.

**The replicated set is the store's.** Every primary records the classes its pool replicates, in
its ``replicated_tables`` table, and a pool refuses to open a store whose record differs from what
it is given. The reader reads that record ``mode=ro`` and yields it as
``ReadOnlyStore.replicated_tables``, in serial order. A primary whose record cannot be read, or
names a class ``factories`` does not declare, is refused. An empty record is what the store says,
and is not refused.

**It cannot write.** It is not "careful"; it has no write path:

- every file is opened ``sqlite:///file:{path}?mode=ro&uri=true``. A read-write open would replay a
  hot rollback journal, which is a write. ``immutable=1`` is never used either: it would hide a
  concurrent writer instead of refusing it;
- a store with a journal file (``ShardedPool._journal_paths``: ``-journal``, ``-wal``, ``-shm``)
  beside its primary or any shard is refused, naming the file, before that file is opened. Such a
  store is open, or was not closed cleanly, and a reading of it describes no instant. The reader
  reports this and repairs nothing;
- there is no ``create_all``, no ``Datastore._ensure_tables``, no DDL and no DML.

**It needs no Ray.** It never calls ``ray.init`` and never constructs a ``Datastore`` actor or a
``ShardedPool``. Importing this module imports ``ray`` transitively, through ``ShardedPool``; that
initialises nothing.

**A store whose files differ from the declared tables is refused.** Every shard file is compared
with the tables ``build_schema`` declares by ``Datastore.SQL.schema.schema_differences``, before
anything reads its tables. A table the file lacks, a table it has that the code does not declare,
a declared column a table lacks, or a column the code does not declare refuses the store with
``StoreSchemaMismatch``, naming the shard, its path and each table and column by kind
(prompts/datastore-generic, prompt 05). Nothing is created here, and the reader has nothing to
recover: a store written by older code is regenerated, not read.
