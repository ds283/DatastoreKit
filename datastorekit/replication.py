"""
The exceptions of the replicated write.

A replicated object is written on a controlling shard and then copied to every other shard, each
in its own transaction (``ShardedPool._replicated_write``). Two things can go wrong that must be
loud rather than silent:

- a replica answers with something other than what the controller wrote: a different serial for
  the same key, a row under the controller's serial whose columns differ, or a different
  validation outcome. That is ``ReplicationMismatch``. It is raised by the driver when it checks
  the replicas' answers, and by a replica's own ``store()`` when it finds the key or the serial
  already taken by something else;
- a replicated write is attempted while the primary's ``replication_in_flight`` table already
  names one. That is ``ReplicationInFlight``. The store is then in the state an interrupted write
  left it, and no write may proceed over it until the store has been reconciled.

When a store is opened, ``ShardedPool`` compares its replicated tables across shards. An interrupted
replication is repaired from the record's controlling shard; any other difference refuses the open
with ``ReplicatedDivergence``.

A store can also be opened read-only (``ShardedPool(read_only=True)``). On it, a lookup that would
insert raises ``ReadOnlyMiss``, and any other write raises ``ReadOnlyWrite``, each before anything
is written.

This module lives at the top of the ``datastorekit`` package, and imports nothing from it, so that
the factories (which raise ``ReplicationMismatch`` inside a Datastore actor), ``ShardedPool`` (which
raises both in the driver) and the tests can all import it without importing Ray's actor classes or
creating an import cycle through ``datastorekit.SQL``.

The exceptions pickle with their fields intact, because under Ray an exception raised inside an
actor reaches the driver by pickling.
