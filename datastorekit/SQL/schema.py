"""
The one schema builder: the ``sqla.Table`` objects and per-class schema records for a set of
storable-class factories.

``Datastore._build_schema`` calls ``build_schema`` and adds only the inserters, which are bound to
the actor's ``_insert`` and so stay in the actor. The read-only store reader
(``Datastore/store_reader.py``) calls it too, with no actor. There is one definition of what the
tables are; do not copy this loop.

Building the schema writes nothing: the tables are declared into ``metadata`` and never created
here. Creating missing tables is ``Datastore._ensure_tables``' job, on a read-write engine.

**The one comparison** of a file against the declared tables is here too
(prompts/datastore-generic, prompt 05). ``schema_differences`` compares one SQLite file's table
and column names with a mapping of declared tables, reading only ``sqlite_master`` and ``PRAGMA
table_info``, and ``StoreSchemaMismatch`` is the one refusal of a file that differs, naming the
file and each table and column by kind. The store reader, the read-write check at open and both pool
constructors' check of the primary use them; do not write a second comparison.

**The order of a drop** is here too (prompts/datastore-generic, prompt 06). ``drop_order`` puts a
set of tables in an order in which each can be dropped while the others are present, derived from
their foreign keys alone; the actor drops the tables it is given in that order. No order is kept by
hand.

**What a drop must take with it** is here too (prompts/datastore-generic-followup, prompt 01).
``dependent_tables`` gives the tables that name a row of the dropped tables, by a foreign key or by
a parent their factory's ``inventory_spec`` declares, followed transitively, so that a read-write
pool can refuse a drop that would leave them naming rows that are gone. It is read from the
registry, never from a store's rows.

**The replication facts a factory declares** are carried here too (prompts/datastore-generic,
prompt 07). Three keys of ``register()``, each checked against the class's own table and copied
into the record of every class with a table: ``owner_column`` (the column whose one foreign key
names the row this table's rows belong to), ``monotone_flags`` (the Boolean columns a get may turn
on and nothing turns off) and ``validated_column`` (the Boolean column of the class's validated
flag, which the factory's ``revalidate`` recomputes from stored rows). A declaration that does not
fit its table raises ``ValueError``.

This module itself imports only ``sqlalchemy``, ``Datastore.contract``, which names the version
table every prepended ``version`` column references, and ``Datastore.store_inventory``, for the
parents a factory declares; that module imports nothing of this package at module scope. Importing
it runs ``Datastore/SQL/__init__.py``, which imports the actor module and so ``ray``; that
initialises nothing.
