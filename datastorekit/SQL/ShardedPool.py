    # THE READ-ONLY POOL
    #
    # ShardedPool(read_only=True) opens an existing store and writes nothing to any of its files.
    # Its construction is _open_read_only, which replaces the whole of the read-write constructor
    # after the attributes are set; the read-write path does not reach it. At open, in order:
    #
    #   1. drop_tables or prune_unvalidated=True: ReadOnlyWrite, before anything is opened;
    #   2. store_reader.open_read_only, through a function-scope import (store_reader imports this
    #      module): a missing primary is refused and nothing is created, not even its directory; a
    #      journal (-journal, -wal, -shm) beside the primary or any shard is refused by its
    #      presence, an empty one included, before any engine is made; every shard is opened
    #      mode=ro, and a shard whose file differs from the declared tables (a table it lacks
    #      included) is refused with StoreSchemaMismatch, before anything reads its tables. The
    #      reader also reads the primary's replicated_tables record, so a primary whose record
    #      cannot be read, or names a class the registry does not declare, is refused here with
    #      the reader's RuntimeError, before step 3's check of the primary;
    #   3. the pool's own engine is mode=ro; the primary is refused with StoreSchemaMismatch if it
    #      differs from the tables _create_engine declares, and then _read_shard_data and
    #      _check_shard_files run on it as they do read-write;
    #   4. the check at open in read-only form (_check_replicated_tables_read_only): a
    #      replication_in_flight record of any operation, prune included, refuses by name before
    #      anything is compared or completed; the replicated tables are compared on mode=ro
    #      engines and a difference refuses as ReplicatedDivergence. No read-write sqlite3.connect
    #      is made: journals were refused by presence in step 2, so there is none to roll back.
    #      No replication_in_flight table is created and nothing is pruned or repaired;
    #   5. the version row is found by _find_version_row, mode=ro, before any actor exists. A
    #      label no shard holds refuses with ReadOnlyMiss, naming the labels the store holds. It is
    #      never written, and set_version is not called: a read-only actor inserts nothing;
    #   6. no broker, no read_largest_store_ids, no notification: no serial is allocated. Every
    #      actor is built with read_only=True and serial_broker=None, and the pool waits for
    #      every constructor through read_only_state. Each actor is then given the version row's
    #      serial with set_lookup_version, which keys its lookups and never its inserts;
    #   7. the read_table_config check, as read-write.
    #
    # Afterwards a replicated object_get goes to one shard's actor, drawn as read_table draws it,
    # with no record and no replication (_get_impl_replicated_table_read_only); object_store,
    # object_validate and a new shard key raise ReadOnlyWrite; the actors' inserters raise
    # ReadOnlyMiss. A class whose factory declares key_on_version is looked up under the pool's
    # label, through the lookup serial each actor was given in step 6.

    #      prune_unvalidated is: completing an interrupted write is repair, not a choice of this
    #      open. A prune record never reaches the get/store/validate licence below;

    #      from every shard and compared by full row; the primary's shard_keys are checked against
    #      the rows of the shard-key class every shard holds;
    #   4. no record and no difference: nothing is written, and the store opens as before;
    #   5. a get, store or validate record, and differences its interrupted write explains: each
    #      row of the record's class that the record's controlling shard holds and another shard
    #      lacks is copied to that shard verbatim (a class whose unit has more than one table as
    #      a unit: its row, its tag rows and the rows that declare it their owner, _unit_tables),
    #      a monotone flag its factory declares and the controller holds set is set, and after a
    #      validate the class's declared validated column is recomputed on each shard by its
    #      factory's revalidate, the factory's own rule. Every shard is then compared again,
    #      inside the repair's transactions; only if they all agree are the shards committed, and
    #      then the record is cleared, in its own commit, last. A record over identical shards is
    #      simply cleared;
    #   6. anything else raises ReplicatedDivergence, and nothing is written.

    # Apart from completing a recorded prune, which deletes exactly the rows the factory's own
    # rule calls unvalidated, this deletes no row but the record's own and sets no flag to

    # THE PRUNE AT OPEN OF A REPLICATED CLASS
    #
    # Under prune_unvalidated, the unvalidated rows of every replicated class whose factory
    # validates at startup (with the rows of its unit, _unit_tables) are deleted by the pool, not by
    # the actors. An actor that pruned its own shard in its constructor did so outside any record,
    # so an open interrupted between actors left shards that differ with nothing to say which is
    # right. _prune_replicated_tables runs in the constructor after the check at open and after
    # replication_in_flight exists, before the broker or any actor exists, on plain connections to
    # the shard files, with no Ray. For each such class:
    #
    #   1. every shard is read, writing nothing, by the factory's own validate_on_startup with
    #      prune=False. If no shard reports an unvalidated row, nothing is written and no record
    #      is made, so a pruning open of a store with nothing to prune writes nothing;
    #   2. a record, operation "prune", naming the class, with no controlling shard, is committed
    #      on the primary in its own transaction, before the first shard is touched;
    #   3. each shard, in ascending id, is pruned in its own transaction by the factory's
    #      validate_on_startup with prune=True, so that the rule for "unvalidated" stays in the
    #      factory. Before the transaction commits, the factory is asked again with prune=False
    #      and must report nothing, and every compared table must have lost rows only, and only
    #      the class's own and those of the other tables of its unit. Otherwise the shard is
    #      rolled back and the open raises with the record left set. The factory catches a
    #      SQLAlchemyError from its own deletes and returns normally, so its return says nothing
    #      about whether the prune took;
    #   4. the record is deleted, in its own commit, last.
    #
    # The prune is idempotent: it deletes the class's unvalidated rows, and only those, so a
    # shard already pruned loses nothing more. That is what lets the check at open complete an
    # interrupted one by running it again (_complete_interrupted_prune). No other replicated
    # write can come between: a record blocks every one, and the check at open runs first.

    # THE REPLICATED WRITE
    #
    # A replicated object is written on a controlling shard, chosen at random per call, and then
    # sent to every other shard, each in its own transaction. _replicated_write is the one path the
    # get, store and validate of a replicated class take, the version row's included
    # (ShardedPool.__init__ writes it here), and the one place that writes and clears the primary's
    # replication_in_flight record for them. The one other writer of that record is the prune at
    # open of a replicated class, whose "prune" record _prune_replicated_tables writes and clears,
    # with no Ray, before any actor exists:
    #
    #   1. the record is committed on the primary, in its own transaction, naming the operation,
    #      the class and the controlling shard. If one is already there, nothing is written;
    #   2. the controlling shard's call is submitted and its answer read;
    #   3. if a replication follows, the record's store_id is filled in (when there is one) and
    #      every replica's call is submitted, each with the controller's serial;
    #   4. every replica's answer is checked against the controller's; a difference raises
    #      ReplicationMismatch;
    #   5. only then is the record deleted.
    #
    # Any exception after step 1 leaves the record set, whether or not the shards in fact differ:
    # a failure reported by the controlling shard may have followed its commit (an actor that dies
    # after committing), and the record is what says so. One timestamp, chosen here, is passed to
    # every shard, so that copies of a row are identical.
