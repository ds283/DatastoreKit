        Initialize an SQL datastore object.

        ``factories`` is the registry of storable classes, name -> factory, that the client gives:
        the actor registers it and builds every table from it, and imports none.
        ``serial_batch_sizes`` maps a table to how many serials the actor leases from the broker at
        a time; a table it does not name leases ``SerialPoolManager``'s default. ``drop_tables``
        names the tables to drop when an existing file is opened read-write, in any order: the actor
        drops them in ``schema.drop_order``'s order, and refuses a name its registry does not
        declare as a table before dropping anything (``_drop_tables``).

        The constructor neither looks up nor inserts the version row. The version row is replicated,
        so ShardedPool finds it, or writes it once through its recorded replicated write, after
        every actor exists, and then gives each actor its serial with ``set_version``. Until then
        every insert into a class whose rows carry a version serial is refused (``_insert``).
        ``version_label`` is kept only to name the label in that refusal.

        ``replicated_tables`` are the classes the pool replicates. The prune at startup of a
        replicated class is the pool's, under a record, before any actor exists
        (``ShardedPool._prune_replicated_tables``); for those classes ``_validate_on_startup``
        here reports only, whatever ``prune_unvalidated`` is.

        ``read_only`` (ShardedPool passes it) opens the file ``mode=ro`` and writes nothing: no file
        is created, no table is dropped or created, and ``_validate_on_startup`` only reports
        (``_open_read_only``). Every factory's ``build`` is handed an inserter that raises
        ``ReadOnlyMiss`` instead of inserting (``_refuse_insert``); ``object_store`` and
        ``object_validate`` raise ``ReadOnlyWrite``; and a write that still reaches SQLite, which
        the ``mode=ro`` file refuses, is re-raised as ``ReadOnlyWrite`` (``_read_only_refusal``).
