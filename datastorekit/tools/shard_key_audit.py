"""
Read-only consistency check for a ShardedPool datastore's shard_keys table.

ShardedPool keeps a shard-key -> shard-id map in two places: in memory
(self._shard_keys, rebuilt on every startup from disk) and on disk, in the
`shard_keys` table of the primary SQLite file, whose primary key column is
`key_serial`. If that column is ever populated with a value other than the
corresponding shard-key object's `store_id` (see the B1 fix in
ShardedPool._assign_shard_keys), the map rebuilt on the next startup diverges
from the one used when records were written, and every record filed under a
displaced key becomes permanently unreachable. This tool detects that
divergence after the fact; it does not prevent it.

This script only ever opens databases read-only (sqlite3 `mode=ro` URIs). It
is structurally incapable of modifying a datastore.

The shard file it attaches for the cross-file check is found exactly as
ShardedPool finds it, by the one resolver in Datastore/shard_paths.py: the
`shards` record's file name, in the primary's own directory. A record that is
not a bare file name, an absolute path included, is refused, so auditing a
copied store can never check the original's shard in place of the copy's.
That module imports only the standard library and is outside the
Datastore.SQL package, so importing it does not pull in ray or sqlalchemy;
the repository root is put on sys.path below so that the script still runs
standalone, from any directory, with no PYTHONPATH.

IMPORTANT -- there is no safe automated repair. Reconstructing the correct
map requires knowing the order in which shard-key objects were originally
assigned, which is not recorded anywhere. If this tool reports a problem,
the remedy is to rebuild the datastore from scratch, not to patch it in
place.

Exit status: 0 for "VERDICT: OK", 1 for "VERDICT: INCONSISTENT", and 2 when
the store cannot be audited at all (it is refused, and no verdict is given):
a primary that is not a completely written current-generation ShardedPool
primary, a shard record that is not a bare file name, or a shard 0 that
exists but cannot be read as a shard (not a database, or without the
shard-key table its primary names). A shard 0 file that is missing is not a
refusal: the cross-file check is skipped and said to be, and the single-file
checks still give a verdict.

Usage:
